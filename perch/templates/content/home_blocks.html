                The camps are organised by Waldorf teachers, public and private teachers together,
                some of whom are also Involved in the Camphill movement and who provide
                educational programs for the children.

            <p>
                We aim to provide our children not only English Language but also activities and life skills
                which includes creative drama, singing, cooking, dynamic movement, games, paintings and
                more in a beautiful national park in the UK.

                It is a wonderful opportunity for children from all backgrounds for self-expression and
                creativity in a safe environment. Our teachers try to bring real life understandings to
                children with care and experiences.
            </p>
            <p>
                Christian camps are also organised with the co-operation of church members in the UK.
